# pill_dispenser

Created a pill dispenser using IOT. Also comes with an integrated phone application created using Flutter API.
The pill dispenser was made using Raspberry PI 4, servo motors, etc.
Also implemented image processing using opencv to check if the correct number of pills have been dispensed.
